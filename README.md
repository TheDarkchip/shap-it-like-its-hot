This repository will contain the code and experiments for a student project on the **stability and reliability of global SHAP explanations** in a credit-scoring context.

The project empirically evaluates global SHAP feature importances under controlled experimental conditions, including:
- varying class imbalance,
- correlated and duplicated features,
- comparison with permutation feature importance (PFI).

Experiments are based on cross-validated evaluations using the German Credit dataset.

**Status:** Work in progress.  
At the time of writing, no finalized experiments or results are included. Code and documentation will be added as the project is implemented.
